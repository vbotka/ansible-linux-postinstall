Ansible role Linux postinstall
==============================

This `role <https://galaxy.ansible.com/vbotka/linux_postinstall/>`_ and the documentation is work in progess. If the documentation of a task is missing it's necessary to review the `source code <https://github.com/vbotka/ansible-linux-postinstall/tree/master/tasks>`_ to learn how to use it. If a functionality is missing consider role
`config_light <https://galaxy.ansible.com/vbotka/config_light>`_. See various `examples <https://github.com/vbotka/ansible-config-light/tree/master/contrib>`_. If *config_light* is not able to do what you want create new tasks.
