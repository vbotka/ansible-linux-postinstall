Default OS specific variables
-----------------------------

The files in the directories ``vars/defaults`` and
``vars/defaults.incr`` keep OS specific variables. The difference
between them is the method how the files are included.

  * **firstfound**: A file in the directory ``vars/defaults`` in the
    order ``ansible_distribution_release``, ``ansible_distribution``,
    and ``ansible_os_family`` is included with the *lookup plugin*
    ``first_found``.

  * **incremental**: All files in the directory ``vars/defaults.incr``
    in the order ``ansible_os_family``, ``ansible_distribution``, and
    ``ansible_distribution_release`` are included in the *loop*. The
    variables in the files overwrite each other.

In addition, also files ``defaults.yml`` and/or ``default.yml`` can be
included.

The method is determined by the variable ``lp_vars_distro`` *(default:
firstfound)*
